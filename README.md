# tic-tac-toe
This is a tic tac toe game application. It is made using HTML, CSS,
and the game logic is made using JavaScript. I used no global variables and 
as many IIFEs as I could. I started by creating the game logic in JavaScript, but 
I quickly found I relied too much on prompts stopoping the code and ran into countless
problems when I tried to give it a UI. I found I needed to approach the game logic based
off each click of the user iterating the steps of the game.
